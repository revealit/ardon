Ardon â€“ a simple open source task board app
===========================================

Still very much a research project. Play around with it if you like, but
don't expect too much.

Development
-----------

When working with the [Ardon][] source code, you might want to use
[supervisor][] to automatically reload your Ardon source code whenever
it changes:

    supervisor bin/ardon
